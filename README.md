# calculator-App
This is a simple calculator application built using the Tkinter library in Python. It has the following features:
1. Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction multiplication, and division
2. Square root calculation
3. Clear entry functionality
4. Decimal point input

# Getting Started
To run the calculator app, simply execute the Python script. The calculator window will appear, and you can start using it right away

# Usage
The calculator has buttons for numbers 0-9, arithmetic operations, square root, clear entry, and decimal point. To perform calculations, follow these steps:
1. Click the desired number buttons to enter the operands.
2. Click the arithmetic operation button to select the desired operation.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for additional operands and operations.
4. Click the equals button to calculate the result.
5. The result will be displayed in the entry field.

To calculate the square root of a number, follow these steps:
1. Enter the number for which you want to calculate the square root.
2. Click the square root button.
3. The square root of the number will be displayed in the entry field.
4. To clear the entry field, click the clear button.

# Code Structure
The code is organized as follows:
1. The CalculatorApp class initializes the calculator window, sets up the entry field, and creates the number, arithmetic operation, square root, clear, and decimal point buttons.
2. The press, equalpress, press_sqrt, and clear methods handle button clicks and update the entry field accordingly.

# Dependencies
This calculator app requires Python 3 and the Tkinter library, which is included in the standard Python distribution.
